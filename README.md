# CSCI 438 Final Project

## General Summary

This is the final project for the CSCI 438 Advanced Game Development course. The project was made using the Godot Game Engine as well as Blender for 3D Modeling. The game is meant to be some kind of Boss Rush style of game. The plan is that there will be multiple bosses to fight in an arena that has several different weapons available to the user. The goal of the game is to defeat all of the bosses in the fastest time possible.

## World Map

The game will take place on one "level" or world map which will resemble an arena with each boss in the center. The same arena will be reused for each boss with each boss being spawned in the center. My plan as of now is to have an indoor arena in a sort of hexagonal shape with multiple levels of verticality. Traveling from one floor of the arena to a floor above it will be done via "jump pads" that the player can step on to launch themselves to the next floor. The player should be able to simply jump down from higher to lower floors without fall damage. 

## Weapons

Each weapon should be picked up from set "weapon pads" which will spawn various weapons. At the beginning of the game, not all weapon pads will be available to the player with new weapon pads becoming available once subsequent bosses are defeated. Weapons have limited amounts of ammo which can be replenished by walking over weapon pads. 

## Bosses

Each boss should be able to turn and track the player and make some kind of attack towards the player. The health of the boss should be continuously shown on the player's HUD.
