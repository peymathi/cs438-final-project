# CSCI 438 Final Project

## General Summary

This is the final project for the CSCI 438 Advanced Game Development course. The project was made using the Godot Game Engine as well as Blender for 3D Modeling. The game is meant to be some kind of Boss Rush style of game. The goal of the game is to defeat the boss as soon as possible.

## World Map

The game will take place on one "level" or world map which will resemble an arena with the boss in the center. My plan as of now is to have an indoor arena in a sort of hexagonal shape with multiple levels of verticality. Traveling from one floor of the arena to a floor above it will be done via "jump pads" that the player can step on to launch themselves to the next floor. The player should be able to simply jump down from higher to lower floors without fall damage. 

## Weapons

Each weapon should be picked up from set "weapon pads" which will spawn various weapons.

## Boss

The boss should be able to turn and track the player as they move around the arena. The boss should also be able to use different attacks on the player. The boss's health should be displayed on the HUD.
